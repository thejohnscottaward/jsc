          <p>Recognized for her pioneering work in determining the three-dimensional structure of biologically important molecules.  Dr. Glusker determined the molecular structure of a hexacarboxylic acid, derived from Vitamin B12, which led to the determination of the previously unknown chemical formula of Vitamin B12, the "anti-pernicious anemia factor," the largest molecular structure to be determined by x-ray diffraction methods as the time.  Her work on the molecular structure of components of the Krebs cycle provided critical new insights into the molecular and biochemical aspects of metabolism.  Her impact on our knowledge of the causes and possible treatment of cancer continued with her determination of the structures of numerous anti-tumor agents and important mutagens, including the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzo[a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, which are the major carcinogens in tobacco smoke.  Her novel triangular plots to represent the positions of metal ions with respect to the three most likely binding atoms in proteins, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, and her skillful analyses have greatly expanded our understanding and appreciation of the roles of metals in catalysis.</p>
