						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/recent/kariko.jpg" alt="Kariko-img" /></span>Katalin Kariko is senior vice president at BioNTech SE, Mainz, Germany from 2013. She is also adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, where she worked for 24 years. She received her PhD in biochemistry from University of Szeged, Hungary, in 1982 when she came to the US for postdoctoral research at Temple University. For four decades, her research has been focusing on RNA-mediated mechanisms with the ultimate goal of developing in vitro-transcribed mRNA for protein therapy. She investigated RNA-mediated immune activation and co-discovered that nucleoside modifications suppress immunogenicity of RNA. This groundbreaking work unlocked the opportunity for the therapeutic use of mRNA. She co-founded and served as CEO of RNARx, a company dedicated to develop nucleoside-modified mRNA for therapy. Her patents, co-invented with Drew Weissman, on nucleoside-modified uridines in mRNA have been used to create the FDA-approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna/NIH. For her achievement she received many prestigious awards, including the Reichstein Medal, Princess Asturias Award, the Vilcek Prize, the Paul Ehrlich Prize, the Breakthrough prize of Germany, and the Lasker-DeBakey Award. </p>

						Drew Weissman is a professor of Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. He received his graduate degrees from Boston University School of Medicine. Weissman, in collaboration with Katalin Kariko, discovered the ability of modified nucleosides in RNA to suppress activation of innate immune sensors and increase the translation of mRNA containing certain modified nucleosides. The nucleoside-modified mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccine platform Weissman’s lab created is used in the first 2 approved COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. They continue to develop other vaccines that induce potent antibody and T cell responses with mRNA–based vaccines. Weissman’s lab also develops methods to replace genetically deficient proteins, edit the genome, and specifically target cells and organs with mRNA-LNPs, including lung, heart, brain, CD4+ cells, all T cells, and bone marrow stem cells. 
					    </p>	
					    <p>The idea of creating a vaccine with messenger RNA, or mRNA, the substance that helps to convert the genetic code in DNA into proteins, goes back decades.  However, early efforts to use mRNA for treating or preventing various diseases failed due to the instability and inflammatory activity of mRNA. At the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman found that certain forms of RNA contained modifications or changes to the chemical structure of the coding letters or nucleosides in RNA and they were not inflammatory, thus suggesting that modifying the nucleosides might suppress the inflammatory nature of RNA. Their seminal work revealed that one of the four building blocks of RNA, uridine, was responsible for triggering inflammation in mice. Using modified nucleotides, they synthesized protein-encoding long mRNAs containing modified nucleosides, including a modified uridine - pseudouridine. Kariko and Weissman found that mRNA containing pseudouridines were non-inflammatory. Most importantly, the pseudouridine-containing mRNA made much more of the protein. They also demonstrated that modified mRNA that coded for a hormone erythropoietin that makes red blood cells was functional when given to mice and Rhesus macaques, opening the potential to use mRNA for the treatment of medical disorders. Together with their colleagues at Penn, they used modified mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles to make vaccines against a variety of different viruses. This modified mRNA was successfully used to create the first 2 vaccines for COVID-19 by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna/NIH. The novel mRNA platform not only accelerates development of new vaccines and other drugs, but because they use the human body to generate the medicine or vaccine, it makes mRNA-based medicine safer, easier to produce, and more affordable. </p>

						<h4>For developing gene therapies for curing retinal degeneration and ocular diseases</h4>
					</header>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/recent/bennett.jpg" alt="Bennett-img" /></span>Jean Bennett’s primary focus is on gene therapy translational studies. She received her PhD degree in Zoology/Cell and Developmental Biology from the University of California, Berkeley and her MD degree from Harvard Medical School. She completed fellowships at the University of California, San Francisco, at Yale University and at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Bennett joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1992 and was promoted to Professor of Ophthalmology and Cell and Developmental Biology in 2004. She holds the F.M. Kirby Chair in Ophthalmology at the Scheie Eye Institute and is also the Co-Director and Founder of the Center for Advanced Retinal and Ophthalmic Therapeutics (CAROT) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. 
							Bennett has established a true “from bench to bedside” program, and thus she is familiar with the steps necessary to go from proof-of-concept all the way to those necessary for testing of safety and efficacy in humans with blinding disease. She was the leader of a team that translated reversal of blindness in animal models to demonstration of efficacy and safety in children and adults. Her team was the first to enroll pediatric subjects with a non-lethal disease as gene therapy participants. Bennett continues to develop gene-based therapies for other retinal degenerative diseases and to tackle some of the limitations of current gene therapy technologies. She mentors scientists and physicians at all career stages, serves on a number of advisory panels, and is an active member of non-profit patient-oriented foundations.

					</header>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/recent/degrado.jpg" alt="Degrado-img" /></span>William (Bill) DeGrado’s work focuses on the design of small molecule drugs, peptides, and proteins to address biological and mechanistic questions. Since 2011, DeGrado has been a professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California San Francisco. Prior to UCSF, he was a member of DuPont Central Research and DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company from 1981 to 1996, and then the Raiziss Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania (1996 – 2011).
							DeGrado graduated from Kalamazoo College in 1978, received his PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Chicago (1981), and right after joined DuPont Central Research. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Inventors.
							DeGrado showed that proteins can be designed from first principles. He pioneered the approach of de novo protein design, which critically tests our understanding of protein folding and function while also laying the groundwork for the design of molecules with enhanced properties.  Among his many seminal contributions is the design of small molecule mimics of antimicrobial peptides that are in clinical trials for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
