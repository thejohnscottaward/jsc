							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/recent/arkles.jpg" alt="arkles-img" /></span>Barry Arkles is a synthetic chemist, inventor, and entrepreneur residing in the Philadelphia area.  He received his BS (1970) and PhD (1976) in chemistry from Temple University.  He has founded three companies with the goals of developing new methods for synthesizing organosilicon and organometallic materials with specific properties and commercializing these materials for industrial applications.  He has published more than 150 scientific papers and has been awarded more than 75 US patents.  
								Dr. Arkles received the American Chemical Society’s Stanley Kipping Award for Silicon Chemistry in 2020. In 2021 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering with the citation “for contributions to organosilicon materials and organometallic and biochemical reagents.”  He was elected a Fellow of the British Royal Society of Chemistry in 2013.

								Dr. Arkles developed a synthetic approach for a key monomer for contact lens materials based on a new pathway and new catalytic method known as T2.  Other variations of this monomer were used later, and eventually Arkles developed functionalized siloxane macromers by terminating living anionic ring-opening polymerization (AROP) with a functional chlorosilane. This approach was utilized by DuPont for Group Transfer Polymerization (GTP) and was later introduced to the Vistakon division of Johnson and Johnson.  The macromer was found to have the structural control necessary to form silicone-hydrogels and resulted in the first silicone hydrogel (soft lens) product introduced to market, Acuvue. Similar technology was introduced by Sauflon/CooperVision as the Clariti Lens. Analogous technology based on AROP but built from silahydrocarbons was introduced by Bausch & Lomb as the Ultra lens.  Today, more than 70% of all contact lenses utilize macromer technology developed by Barry Arkles and coworkers at the company he founded, Gelest Inc.
								
								Other impactful discoveries and inventions of Dr. Barry Arkles are silicone interpenetrating polymer networks, with applications ranging from fuel pumps to medical devices, such as catheters; thermoplastic composites  strong, lightweight plastics that have replaced metal in many commercial products; silane coupling agents that allow bonding of organic molecules to inorganic surfaces, with applications ranging from hydrophobic coatings critical for heat shield tiles on the NASA Space Shuttle to coatings for protection of historic stone buildings and statues; specialty silicon polymers designed for breathable soft contact lenses and other medical devices; and interlayer dielectrics and metallization—novel inorganic systems for fabricating the integrated semiconductor devices found in computers and many modern electronic devices.

						</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/recent/beauchamp.jpg" alt="beauchamp-img" /></span>Gary Beauchamp received his PhD in biopsychology in 1971 from the Pritzker School of Medicine of the University of Chicago.  He joined the newly formed Monell Chemical Senses Center of the University of Pennsylvania in 1971 as a post-doctoral fellow and has remained at Monell for his entire academic career. Currently he is Distinguished Member and Director, and President Emeritus of the Center. He was Monell’s Director and President from 
								1990 until 2014.  Together with students, Monell colleagues, and collaborators from academic and commercial institutions from around the world,
								Dr. Beauchamp has conducted basic and translational research in the fields of taste, smell and flavor encompassing techniques ranging from behavioral to molecular biology.
								
								During Dr. Beauchamp’s distinguished and eclectic research career, he has investigated functions and mechanisms of the chemical senses  taste, smell, and related senses  from a variety of perspectives.  Recently he and his colleagues have demonstrated that odors communicate health status and have extended this work to encompass odors of diagnostic significance for human disease.
								
								In a second research focus on salt (NaCl) taste, Dr. Beauchamp and his colleagues were the first to prove that human perception and preference depend upon how much salt they consume. This work has had major health policy implications: it serves as a scientific basis for advice from the National Academies report (written in part by Dr. Beauchamp) to the FDA that salt in manufactured foods should be gradually reduced. It is estimated that successfully accomplishing this strategy would annually save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in health costs in the US alone. Currently he and his collaborators are investigating the possibility of using the same strategy to reduce intake of added sugar.
								
								A third recent research focus involves health benefits of the Mediterranean diet and in particular extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). He originally observed that a specific sensory quality of high-end EVOOs, a distinct burn or sting localized to the throat, was identical to the sensory properties of ibuprofen when dissolved in water. Knowing that the sensory properties of a compound may reflect and predict its pharmacological effects, he and colleagues discovered a natural anti-inflammatory in EVOO (named oleocanthal by them) that helps explain the well-documented healthfulness of the Mediterranean diet.  Subsequent research by his group as well as many others have identified oleocanthal as a particularly promising natural anti-inflammatory that has anti-cancer and anti-neurodegenerative properties as well as other potential health benefits.

						</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/recent/bonini.jpg" alt="bonini-img" /></span>Nancy Bonini did her postdoctoral study at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California from 1988-1994, after receiving a PhD in neuroscience from the University of Wisconsin in 1987.   She established the Bonini Lab in 1994 at the University of Pennsylvania, where the focus is on using the model organism Drosophila (fly) to reveal insight into genes, mechanisms and risk factors for human brain degenerative disease, studying problems of neural degeneration, acute neural injury and aging of the brain.  Initial findings showed that it is possible to model a human degenerative state in the simple model organism Drosophila with remarkable precision, then “cure” it with the molecular chaperone Hsp70.  The Bonini Lab’s research demonstrates how such a model can be used to increase biological understanding and develop a foundation for therapeutics, showing by example how genetic modifier pathways identified and characterized in Drosophila can define pathways of great relevance to human disease intervention.  The lab has continued establishing and studying various models of human brain dysfunction due to aging through powerful genetic approaches.

								Dr. Bonini has fundamentally changed the way model organisms are used in science.  Model organisms are  simple systems that are employed in laboratories across the world to experimentally define biological pathways involved in many processes.  They are essential to mechanistic science because they can be readily cultivated and studied in many ways in the laboratory. Dr. Bonini applied model organism genetics to an entirely new problem: human disease.  Her work has opened up the entire armamentarium of model organism genetic tools to be applied toward the problems of human disease, igniting a renaissance with this new and powerful application of model organisms.  Model organism genetics is now a standard tool employed across the world for insight into many important human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
								
								The numerous awards Dr. Bonini has received for her work include a David and Lucile Packard Award; a John Merck Scholars Award; an NIH EUREKA Award; an Ellison Senior Scholars Award; and an NIH R35 Outstanding Investigator Award.  She is the Editor of the Annual Reviews of Genetics and she has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Bonini was named an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, in addition to being elected to the board of the Genetics Society of America in 2007 and the National Drosophila Board in 2010.

She is also adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, where she worked for 24 years. She received her PhD in biochemistry from University of Szeged, Hungary, in 1982 when she came to the US for postdoctoral research at Temple University. For four decades, her research has been focusing on RNA-mediated mechanisms with the ultimate goal of developing in vitro-transcribed mRNA for protein therapy. She investigated RNA-mediated immune activation and co-discovered that nucleoside modifications suppress immunogenicity of RNA. This groundbreaking work unlocked the opportunity for the therapeutic use of mRNA. She co-founded and served as CEO of RNARx, a company dedicated to develop nucleoside-modified mRNA for therapy. Her patents, co-invented with Drew Weissman, on nucleoside-modified uridines in mRNA have been used to create the FDA-approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna/NIH. For her achievement she received many prestigious awards, including the Reichstein Medal, Princess Asturias Award, the Vilcek Prize, the Paul Ehrlich Prize, the Breakthrough prize of Germany, and the Lasker-DeBakey Award. </p>

						Drew Weissman is a professor of Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. He received his graduate degrees from Boston University School of Medicine. Weissman, in collaboration with Katalin Kariko, discovered the ability of modified nucleosides in RNA to suppress activation of innate immune sensors and increase the translation of mRNA containing certain modified nucleosides. The nucleoside-modified mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccine platform Weissman’s lab created is used in the first 2 approved COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. They continue to develop other vaccines that induce potent antibody and T cell responses with mRNA–based vaccines. Weissman’s lab also develops methods to replace genetically deficient proteins, edit the genome, and specifically target cells and organs with mRNA-LNPs, including lung, heart, brain, CD4+ cells, all T cells, and bone marrow stem cells. 
					    </p>	
					    <p>The idea of creating a vaccine with messenger RNA, or mRNA, the substance that helps to convert the genetic code in DNA into proteins, goes back decades.  However, early efforts to use mRNA for treating or preventing various diseases failed due to the instability and inflammatory activity of mRNA. At the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman found that certain forms of RNA contained modifications or changes to the chemical structure of the coding letters or nucleosides in RNA and they were not inflammatory, thus suggesting that modifying the nucleosides might suppress the inflammatory nature of RNA. Their seminal work revealed that one of the four building blocks of RNA, uridine, was responsible for triggering inflammation in mice. Using modified nucleotides, they synthesized protein-encoding long mRNAs containing modified nucleosides, including a modified uridine - pseudouridine. Kariko and Weissman found that mRNA containing pseudouridines were non-inflammatory. Most importantly, the pseudouridine-containing mRNA made much more of the protein. They also demonstrated that modified mRNA that coded for a hormone erythropoietin that makes red blood cells was functional when given to mice and Rhesus macaques, opening the potential to use mRNA for the treatment of medical disorders. Together with their colleagues at Penn, they used modified mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles to make vaccines against a variety of different viruses. This modified mRNA was successfully used to create the first 2 vaccines for COVID-19 by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna/NIH. The novel mRNA platform not only accelerates development of new vaccines and other drugs, but because they use the human body to generate the medicine or vaccine, it makes mRNA-based medicine safer, easier to produce, and more affordable. </p>

She was the leader of a team that translated reversal of blindness in animal models to demonstration of efficacy and safety in children and adults. Her team was the first to enroll pediatric subjects with a non-lethal disease as gene therapy participants. Bennett continues to develop gene-based therapies for other retinal degenerative diseases and to tackle some of the limitations of current gene therapy technologies. She mentors scientists and physicians at all career stages, serves on a number of advisory panels, and is an active member of non-profit patient-oriented foundations.
